# Team A

[Zach](zach): 
    
    [1]Setup initial project setup, github organization, and defined the required memory address variables 
    we're going to need. Still need to work on documentation and documentation template. For now I think markdown/readme
    is fine. We can manage issues and sorting through github.

    [2]Setup Travis.CI so we can confirm build passing. Added build passing info to the primary README.md in project root.
